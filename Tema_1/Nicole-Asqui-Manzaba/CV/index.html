                <p>Software development: I participated in the development of an application using Python for the backend and React for the frontend. I worked on the implementation of functionalities and the creation of components both on the server and client side.
                    Software testing: I used Jest for frontend testing and Pytest for backend testing. I ensured code quality and application functionality by performing unit, integration and end-to-end testing.
                    Hexagonal architecture: I worked with hexagonal architecture to ensure a modular and scalable structure in the development of the application. I separated the business logic from the rest of the components, which facilitated the maintenance and extensibility of the system.
                    Team collaboration: I worked closely with the development team using agile methodologies, such as Scrum. I participated in daily follow-up meetings, sprint planning and retrospectives, which allowed for effective communication and iterative and adaptive development.</p>
